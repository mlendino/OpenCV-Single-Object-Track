# OpenCV-Single-Object-Track
This repository is the part of the summer research, lead by Professor Dirk Martin Luchtenburg at The Cooper Union during summer 2017, to track and display the motion of an autonomous boat using OpenCV C++.  In the case of generated gyres in the tank of water, this code also served the purpose of tracing out the curves generated as the boat moved along the gyre.  While the code enclosed only covers tracing out the path curves of a single moving boat, these results could be trivially extended to track multiple moving boats "going with the flow" of the gyre.
